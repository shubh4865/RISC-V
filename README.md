# RISC-V
RISC-V, pronounced "Risk-Five," originated as a research project in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley. The motivation behind its development was the complexity of existing commercial instruction set architectures (ISAs) and the legal challenges posed by intellectual property (IP) rights. To address these issues, RISC-V was designed as a simple, open-source alternative, freely available under a permissive license. Unlike proprietary ISAs, RISC-V is not a company or a specific CPU implementation; instead, it serves as a flexible ISA that anyone can implement.

RISC-V uses a standard naming convention to describe the supported ISAs in a given implementation. The naming format, RV[###][abc…xyz], indicates a RISC-V architecture, where [###] specifies the width of the integer register file and the size of the user address space, and [abc…xyz] denotes the set of extensions supported by the implementation. The structure of RISC-V’s ISA is characterized by a small number of fixed-size registers, with RV32I featuring 32 32-bit registers and RV64 having 32 64-bit registers. This design choice keeps the architecture simple and reduces complexity, striking a balance between efficiency and functionality.

RISC-V instructions are categorized into three types: computational operations, load/store operations, and control flow instructions. Computational operations involve performing arithmetic and logical functions on data within registers, while load/store operations handle data transfer between memory and the register file. Control flow instructions manage the program’s execution, directing jumps to different code segments as needed. The base integer ISA in RISC-V is encoded using 32-bit fixed-width, naturally aligned instructions, with specific types like R-type, I-type, S-type, and U-type instructions that handle various operations.

The RV32I base integer ISA includes 47 instructions that implement essential operations for basic 32-bit integer functionality, and its 64-bit variant, RV64I, extends this capability. These instructions cover arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, bitwise operations, data transfers, and control flow management. The base ISA also specifies 32 CPU registers, each 32 bits wide, with the program counter included as well. Notably, the x0 register is special, always reading as zero. In summary, RISC-V’s open-source, modular design offers a simple yet powerful ISA that is adaptable to a wide range of computing needs, from embedded systems to high-performance processors.
